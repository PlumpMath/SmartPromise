    <p />
    SmartPromise is an electronic journal of smart promises developed through Blockchain.
    User of such an environment receives a reward for each of his fulfilled promises.
    The concept of the idea contains the possibility to get a strong motivation to action that user pointed in promise.
    <p />
    User creates a promise in the journal, sets the deadline for its implementation and at the end of this period provides
    evidence of the fulfillment of his promise. Then user gets a reward for keeping the promise.
    Rewards will be issued by crypto assets and it will consist of users contributions.
    Reward is a contribution multiplied by a factor that depends on difficulty of keeping a promise.
    Thus by contributing user make a deal with himself. The promise fulfilled - the deal is successful.
    <p />
    We set ourselves the goal of promoting the disclosure of personal motivation. If, one day,
    a person wants to start running in the morning, but he lacks motivation, our project can help him in the implementation of his plan.
    <p />
    In future, we plan to develop our idea by expanding SmartPromise concept to SmartContract
    which will allow to keep transparency of business deals between participants.
